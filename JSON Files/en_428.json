  "LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_30": "It shocks me that an enemy army so big managed to approach our capital completely undetected. This means there must be a traitor in our ranks! Thank you for your feats of valor, Guardians!",
  "LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_31": "We know how hard it is to decide the fate others. Yet justice must remain above all! You have made the right decision, Guardians!",
  "LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_32": "That was outstanding! You have passed the test with flying colors, and are worthy of praise!",
  "LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_33": "That was a daring and risky move, yet you have completed the quest. Mayhap you are the only ones who can stop the Darkness encroaching on your world!",
  "LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_34": "That voice! You could never forget it! The revelations spoken by the Warden made all quiver, as unto thunder amidst a clear day. The angels themselves echo those words and trust you all, Guardians!",

  "LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_37": "So it comes out, the thieves turned out to be a bunch of flunkies for the usurpers seeking to take the throne for themselves. If Ingvar is ever deposed, the Dominion will be thrown into chaos. You have the gratitude of the Emperor himself, Guardians!",
  "LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_38": "We were within a hair's breadth of losing it all, but Cornelius, the beacon of science, has lived to see the new day. All thanks to you, Guardians! The whole of the Dominion is in your debt!",
  "LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_39": "Kdaeer Khani thank you heartily and wishes for you to take these well-deserved gifts. Oh, and he also asked me to tell you that all Guardians will be welcome at the Adjalar oasis, should you visit it.",
  "LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_4": "It was foolish to hope you would meet no foes on the way. But you have succeeded in your quest, and the Strongford University has gained new knowledge that will help us fight the Darkness!",
  "LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_40": "Hail to the gods! And to you, Guardians! Emperor Ingvar remains alive and well, thanks to your loyalty and service. Take this bravely earned reward!",
  "LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_41": "It appears that Vadjar found a winding road through the cliffs from the very heart of the blazing plains. The city would be an ocean of fire if you were not there! Thank you.",
  "LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_5": "That was an unspeakable battle, and yet;\n you have prevailed, Guardians! Sylfide may have gotten away unscathed, but the children are back home now. The miller and his wife asked us to give you this, as a reward.",
  "LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_6": "How do you even do this? You managed to catch up with the garrison, spearheaded the attack and destroyed the evil without any losses. Truly a feat of valor worthy of the Guardians! The Emperor himself has sent you this reward!",
  "LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_7": "Did you see that? A whole camp full of snoring orcs! What a lovely sight. Our plan was successful, and every success comes with a reward!",
  "LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_8": "Ugh, it's as if the orcs write with their feet! Thank you for their writing samples, Guardians. They are on their way to be deciphered in the capital. Here's your reward!",
  "LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_AFTER_9": "Who could have guessed that these lands concealed entire troll cities?!",
  "LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_1": "Food has become scarce in the forest areas, and starvation is looming over the land. And what's worse, Sylfide's lackeys in Wilheim further muddy the waters. We must deliver these provisions and keep the people from starving to death.",
  "LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_10": "Artemis is on her way to the capital with an urgent report, but the orcs have tracked her and are on their way to chase her down. We must collapse the Dilapidated Bridge on Hardan's Plateau, but only after Artemis crosses over to the other side. Then she'll be safe from her pursuers.",
  "LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_11": "Never before have so many fiends have stepped into the summoning circle! Even Gagaron himself has arrived to complete the ritual! This dark scheme must be disrupted by a sudden ambush and the death of the orc shamans' chieftain. We must hurry!",
  "LIB_EXPEDITION_STORY_DESC_BEFORE_12": "Harun's army needs reinforcements! The battle on the southern plateau was going smoothly until Brog the Conqueror arrived on the battlefield.

  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_129": "Explode? The reactor is powered by the underground channels of the elemental powers! The explosion will destroy half the planet! We can't let it happen!",

  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_131": "The king is dead? This is a great loss for our people...",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_132": "The reactor won't cool down by itself, though. We have to replenish the coolant supply, or it will explode sooner or later.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_133": "Look, the coolant supply has been drained into the tanks near the city wall.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_134": "I hope you can cool down the reactor with it in time! Pour the coolant in the technical compartment!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_135": "You made it! The reactor is cooling down!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_136": "It doesn't pose a threat anymore. Now we can proceed, and help Ragni.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_137": "These are the lower levels. We're approaching the Abode of the Masters!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_138": "You guys don't seem to be in a hurry! You should be, though.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_139": "The abode is surrounded by the fanatics. I can see them. They're going somewhere down the path, into the depth.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_14": "Servants of darkness, destroy the Guardians!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_140": "Hey, Ragni, our efforts didn't go to waste when we drommers were creating the Circle of Summoning and the Titan Spheres.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_141": "Really?",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_142": "Of course! Just remember what happened before. The quarrel between the humans and the Titans, the first war with Darkness, and the disembodiment of the Titans in the Elemental Ether.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_143": "I'm well aware of this story. What's your point?",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_144": "Ever since we figured out how to disembody Titans in the Circle of Summoning, the Titans and the humans learned to understand each other and forgot their bad blood.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_145": "Stop talking nonsense! It can't have happened!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_146": "How else would I have brought the Guardians here alongside an entire Titan squad?",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_147": "I might believe you if you save me!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_148": "Ugh, listening to these crazy creatures mutter makes my skin crawl...",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_149": "Actually, Tellm started speaking just like that when we last met.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_15": "The evil is near, stay alert!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_150": "Tellm? Isn't that one of your ''Invincible Four?''",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_151": "Yes, but he started avoiding us from that day on.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_152": "The examination? Is that the day you mean, Master Ragni?",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_153": "Yes. Tellm was the only one who failed it. I believe he was furious with the entire world, not just us.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_154": "The worst part is that Tellm claims I ''stole'' his element. Fire itself chose me, though!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_155": "Hey? Master Ragni, where are you?",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_156": "Whew, finally! I almost forgot what it's like to enjoy freedom! Dugg the Constructor, what happened to the city?",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_157": "I can't believe my eyes! Ghirwil City lost its roof! Something really terrible is going on here!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_158": "You leave a city unsupervised a little while, and this is what happens. No good...",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_159": "Seriously! Not now, alright? The bridge is non-functional. Look, the fanatics are trying to cross it, falling down into the abyss!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_16": "In the name of Archdemon!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_160": "What do we do now, Master?",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_161": "Well... The technology of the Rainbow Bridge is based on the titanic function of the three elements. The only element powering the bridge right now is Fire.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_162": "These pillars are all that's left in the city from the Titan Valley. I'm sure we can find what we need there!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_163": "We have to collect Shards of Earth and Water to restore the balance.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_164": "Well done! The bridge is functioning again!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_165": "Ragni... you still live? What a shame... Thanks for rebuilding the bridge, by the way.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_166": "You couldn't have done anything dumber! Ha!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_167": "And you, Tellm, you look as though you're standing at death's door. What happened to you?",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_168": "What would you know about the sacrifices one can offer to science and progress!?",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_169": "You were just lucky to become a master, taking my element, MY ELEMENT!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_17": "I'll break your spines!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_170": "You're full of spite... Answer me, Tellm, do you have anything to do with what's going on in the city? With the king's madness?",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_171": "The king was naive. As for you, you have yet to recognize my genius, surpassing any other by a thousandfold!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_172": "Master Ragni, we have to overtake Tellm. He clearly has something to do with all this!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_173": "Overtake? You must be mad, Guardian Mimir! I've sacrificed too much for my discoveries.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_174": "You've been having fun while I dedicated each passing moment of my life to science!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_175": "And so, I'm the one who deserves to make the discovery that will turn this world on its head!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_176": "I discovered an object of an unknown element, its power beyond anything known before!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_177": "Don't you dare touch the fanatics and madmen. I created them. They're mine!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_178": "Do you even realize what you've done, Tellm!?",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_179": "Silence! Every one of them will become an obsidian statue, a black soul stone for the Titan I need so much!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_18": "Use super-blow!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_180": "You're late for the ritual. It has already begun! Now, behold my new form, my immense power!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_181": "Holy Forerunners! It... it just... killed Tellm! It tore him apart!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_182": "Bow before my might! I am reborn, brimming with power! Today marks the day that everyone remembers who Seymour is!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_183": "The ancient war between humans and Titans isn't over yet.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_184": "Oh, the irony! How could the drommers, the smartest race on this planet, have made the dumbest mistake ever?",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_185": "Tellm... Poor Tellm... You were deceived. Your thirst for new discoveries was the death of you.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_186": "This evil has to be put to an end!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_187": "What do we do, Ragni? Seymour is a dark Titan from the ancient past.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_188": "His might is colossal, and his hatred knows no bounds.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_189": "He was the one to drive a wedge between humans and Titans. He was later disembodied into the Elemental Ether, together with his entire race.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_19": "Open magical chests to unlock new heroes and evolve your team!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_190": "Whoever he is, he's pure evil. And evil must be banished!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_191": "May the eternal light shine in the darkness!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_192": "The spawn of Darkness which caused the rift between the humans and the Titans was defeated by them so many years later!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_193": "Deliverance in death is too light a punishment for an evil so terrible.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_194": "It grants eternal life in the blessed Elemental Ether, together with an opportunity for reincarnation.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_195": "Endless contemplation in the bonds of the Light is fair retribution.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_196": "You made it. Humans, drommers, and Titans.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_197": "You proved ready to move on, past former grievances, and protect your home together.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_198": "Farewell, Guardians of the Dominion. Your path in the land of the drommers has come to an end.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_199": "An iron plate covered with symbols... What a curious finding!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_2": "The Portal will quickly deliver me to the battlefield!",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_20": "I'm also looking for Archdemon who is hiding somewhere in your lands.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_200": "I can decipher these writings for you.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_201": "This is a fragment of Ghirwil City's history.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_202": "Collect the rest of the fragments, and then we might be able to find out the cause of what happened in the city.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_203": "Oh no, this is the worst that could happen! Seymour is a dark Titan from the ancient past, who turned the entire world into a battlefield soaked with blood.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_204": "His hatred knows no bounds, and his might keeps growing stronger with each new black soul stone.",
  "LIB_TUTORIAL_TEXT_205": "More and more fanatics are sacrificing themselves, which means the Titan will soon incarnate and free himself from the bonds of the ether.",
